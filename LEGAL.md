# Legal Statement of Operations

**Date:** 2024-05-22
**Software Version:** Vouch v0.1.0

## 1. Executive Summary

This document describes the technical methodology employed by the **Vouch** software library to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of digital forensic records. It is intended for use by legal counsel, auditors, and technical validators.

## 2. Cryptographic Standards

Vouch utilizes industry-standard cryptographic primitives to secure the audit trail. No proprietary or non-standard encryption algorithms are used.

*   **Hashing Algorithm:** SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit).
*   **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) with a 2048-bit key size.
*   **Signature Scheme:** RSASSA-PSS (RSA Signature Scheme with Appendix - Probabilistic Signature Scheme) using MGF1 (Mask Generation Function 1).

## 3. Chain of Custody Methodology

### 3.1. Identity Verification (Non-Repudiation)
Every audit session is cryptographically signed using a private key held solely by the analyst.
*   **Mechanism:** Upon completion of an analysis session, the software generates a detached signature (`signature.sig`) of the `audit_log.json` file.
*   **Legal Implication:** A valid signature confirms that the audit log was generated by the holder of the private key and has not been modified since signing.
*   **Verification:** For legal defensibility, the recipient MUST verify the signature against a trusted copy of the analyst's public key (using `vouch verify --public-key ...`), rather than relying solely on the public key embedded within the package (which proves integrity but not identity).

### 3.2. Data Integrity
Vouch employs a strict hashing protocol for all inputs and outputs.
*   **Arguments & Results:** Every function argument and return value is serialized and hashed using SHA-256. These hashes are embedded in the immutable `audit_log.json`.
*   **File Provenance:** When external data files (e.g., CSV, JSON) are ingested via supported methods, Vouch calculates the SHA-256 hash of the file content.
*   **Verification:** The `vouch verify` tool re-calculates hashes of local files and compares them against the signed record. Any bit-level discrepancy (e.g., changing a single character) results in a verification failure.

### 3.3. Environment Reproducibility
To ensure that results can be reproduced by third parties, Vouch captures the exact state of the computational environment.
*   **Dependency Locking:** The `environment.lock` file contains a complete list of all Python packages and their specific versions (e.g., `pandas==2.0.3`) present at runtime.
*   **System Metadata:** The operating system, platform version, and Python interpreter version are recorded.

## 4. Artifact Structure (.vch)

The Vouch Audit Package (`.vch`) is a standard ZIP archive containing:

1.  `audit_log.json`: The chronological record of all operations, arguments, and results (Signed Content).
2.  `signature.sig`: The cryptographic signature of the audit log (Detached Signature).
3.  `public_key.pem`: The public key required to verify the signature (Identity).
4.  `environment.lock`: The system state snapshot (Context).

## 5. Conclusion

The Vouch system provides a mathematically verifiable chain of custody. By linking the identity of the analyst (Private Key) to the specific actions performed (Audit Log) and the data used (SHA-256 Hashes), it creates a record that is tamper-evident and legally defensible.
